Installation
============

To install GIFtools, you will need to go the the website and download the
latest `installation executable <https://gif.eos.ubc.ca/GIFtools/downloads>`_
(Log-in required). To obtained a login, please `contact us
<http://gif.eos.ubc.ca/contact>`_

- :ref:`System Requirement <systemRequirements>`


Installation notes
------------------

The two available executables are either ``GIFtools_vXpX_install`` or
``GIFtools_vXpX_offlineInstall``. The only difference is that the off-line
install is much bigger to ensure that the Matlab run-time environment that is
needed is accessible if not already installed. The former installation
executable will use the internet to call Matlab to check on the environment
and download if necessary. Either way, **you will need administrator
privileges**. Once downloaded here are the 7 steps to follow:


1. Double click on executable, which will lead you to this screen (you can trust us...):

.. figure:: ../images/giftoolsInstall1.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400



If you use a proxy server *and* you are using the `GIFtools_vXpX_install.exe`, you will need to click on the **Connection Settings** button and put the server name and port along with a user ID and password to access the internet.

2. Click **Next** and choose the installation directory for GIFtools. This does *not* necessarily need to be in ``C:\Program Files\GIF``! If you have created another folder somewhere on your computer, you may install GIFtools there (e.g., ``D:\GIFtools\``)

.. figure:: ../images/giftoolsInstall2.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400



**NOTE 1**:  If you have previous versions of GIFtools on your computer, you can put the latest version in the parent directory (e.g., ``C:\Program Files\GIF``). This directory will also be where you should place all of your executables (i.e. inversion executables, MeshTools3D, etc.) that GIFtools would require. Here is an example:

.. figure:: ../images/giftoolsInstall3.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400



**NOTE 2**: If you chose the ``Add a shortcut to the desktop`` option, you will need to perform step 7 on that shortcut too!


4. Click **Next**: One of two things will now happen, either (1) you will have to install the run-time compiler or (2) the compiler will already be installed. If (1), follow the on-screen instructions (most likely just keep clicking next) and this will lead you to step 5. If (2) this window will show up:

.. figure:: ../images/giftoolsInstall4.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400


5. You are ready for install! Click **Install >**. It will take a minute or two.

.. figure:: ../images/giftoolsInstall5.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400



6. If everything worked out, you will get to the screen below giving you step 7's instructions. Click **Finish** and **read below to finish the install** so the link is not broken.

.. figure:: ../images/giftoolsInstall6.png
    :align: center
    :width: 400



7. Fix the *Start-in*  directory link for GIFtools. Go to the Start menu and find `GIFtools_vXpX` and **right-click** and select **properties**:

.. figure:: ../images/giftoolsInstall7.png
    :align: center
    :width: 300



Note that the *Start in:* field is blank. **Copy and paste** the *Target:*  field to the *Start in:* field. Then **remove GIFtools_vXpX.exe from the Start in** field so that only the directory is present:

.. figure:: ../images/giftoolsInstall8.png
    :align: center
    :width: 300

Click **Apply** and then **OK**. GIFtools is now installed and can be started from the Start menu


.. tip:: *Why did we have to do step 7?* Windows makes a copy in the registry and starts GIFtools there. The visualization package (VTK) that is used requires static Java libraries and therefore GIFtools needs to be started where those dynamic libraries are located.

.. tip:: *Manual shortcuts to desktop do not require step 7!* If you have gone into GIFtools ``application`` directory, right-clicked and chose ``Create shortcut``, then the the shortcut (by default it will ask you if you want to put it on the desktop) will already have the *Start in:* field adjusted.

Python Installation (Optional)
------------------------------

Starting from version 2.25, GIFtools has the option to run some functionalities from the open-source community.
In order to get access to these codes, users must install Python and few additional packages. This is done through the Anaconda
project. Please follow these steps to get setup:

- (Windows Users) Update/install  `Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 <https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads>`_
    - Some Python packages use C++ to speed up core functions (i.e. `SimPEG <simpeg.xyz>`_)

- Download the `installation package <https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~dfournie/simpeg_install.zip>`_
- Launch the Miniconda installation

        :width: 400

    - For new users, recommended to let Anaconda set the Environment Path
        .. figure:: ../images/AnacondaPath.png
            :align: center
            :width: 400

- Open a Command Terminal in the current directory (Shift+rightClick) and enter:

    .. figure:: ../images/OpenCommand.png
        :align: center
        :width: 400



Enter>    `conda env create -f environment.yml`

    .. figure:: ../images/InstallEnvironment.png
        :align: center
        :width: 600

Full installation time :math:`\approx 15` min

Congratulation, you should now have access to the `Python ecosystem <http://www.developintelligence.com/blog/python-ecosystem-2017/>`_!
More packages can be installed through command lines:

Either with anaconda (recommanded)>  `conda install anotherPackage`

or alternatively through pip>   `pip install somePackageName`
